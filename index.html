        <h2>KISS, an acronym for keep it simple, stupid</h2>

        <p>
            A design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple
            rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
            The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson. The term "KISS principle" was in popular use by 1970.
            Variations on the phrase include: "Keep it simple, silly", "keep it short and simple", "keep it short and sweet",
            "keep it simple and straightforward", "keep it small and simple", "keep it simple, soldier", "keep it simple, sailor",
            or "keep it sweet and simple".
